           Hello, my name is Jaime Ofner. I was born on February 6, 1994 at Met Hospital in Windsor, Ontario. My parents names are Donna and Robert Ofner. I have an older brother Erich and younger sister Claire. I graduated from St. Anne's High School in 2012. After graduating I pursued a Bachelor of Fine Arts at Western University. My medium of choice was printmaking. I focused on silk screen and intaglio. After my Bachelors I moved to Toronto and began working as a print assistnt for T-Shirt Elephant, a personal apparel printing company. While there I was introduced to the role of a graphic designer and decided to go back to school to pursue this career. I moved back home to Windsor and began my Graphic Design diploma at St. Clair College.

            My interests outside of school are recreational sports leagues with my friends, such as beach volleyball and soccer. I also like to travel with my family, we enjoy hiking, kayaking, scuba diving and camping. Last year we rescued two dogs named Goose and Maverick, they are brothers. They are inseperable. They are also a lot of work. But we still love them.
